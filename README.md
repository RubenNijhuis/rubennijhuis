Nice to meet you my name is Ruben Nijhuis <br>
In my day to day life I work on web development challenges at startups, make cool projects at Codam Coding College and create documentation and tools to make developing for developers easier.

Along side coding I love traning my creative muscle by designing posters and 3D artwork. Which you can find here - https://rubennijhuis.com/gallery

I am always up for a challenge so if you need help with your project or want someone to spar with, hit me up!
