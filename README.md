Nice to meet you! 👋 My name is Ruben Nijhuis, a creative developer based in Amsterdam. Working in the visual space 👻

In my day-to-day life, I work on web development challenges at startups, create cool projects at Codam Coding College, and write documentation and tools to make developing for developers easier. Alongside coding, I love training my creative muscle by designing posters, creating 3D artwork, and exploring urban photography. You can find my work <a href="https://rubennijhuis.com/gallery">here →</a>

Currently, I am changing the way we approach habits in our daily life at a startup called MTTRS. Creating an app where social interactivity empowers people who want to create a healthy and sustainable lifestyle.

I am always up for a challenge so if you need help with your project or want someone to spar with, hit me up!
